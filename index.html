        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a results-driven Applications Development Manager with a strong foundation in intelligent automation, cloud technology, and digital transformation. With dual undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Marketing, and a graduate degree in Computer Science, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and business acumen to every project I undertake.

Throughout my career at Genworth, I've advanced from roles in IT security and support to specializing in intelligent automation and application development. My work centers around implementing cloud-first solutions with platforms like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, including Document AI and Vertex AI, to drive operational efficiency and enhance business functions. 

Beyond technical delivery, I’m passionate about fostering collaboration and guiding high-performing teams, and I champion inclusivity as co-leader of our Women in Technology ERG.

I am dedicated to delivering impactful solutions that meet and exceed organizational objectives, always looking to innovate and optimize processes.

If you’d like to learn more about me, or have a project I can help with, please reach out via email (nianacelestine@gmail.com).</p>
